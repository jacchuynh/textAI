**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Completion Date**: June 4, 2025  
**Test Results**: 100% (All phases 5-7 tests passed)  

## Overview

Phases 5-7 of the Domain System Rehaul have been successfully implemented, completing the sophisticated unified progression system. This implementation adds insight point spending mechanisms, enhanced mastery path generation with anti-grinding systems, and comprehensive world response integration.

## Phase 5: Insight Point Spending Mechanisms ✅ COMPLETE

### Implemented Features

#### Domain Progression Tiers
- **7-tier progression system**: Novice (0-7) → Skilled (8-12) → Adept (13-17) → Expert (18-22) → Master (23-27) → Grandmaster (28-32) → Legendary (33-50)
- **Advancement cost calculations**: Progressive cost structure with `get_advancement_cost()` method
- **Tier determination**: `get_domain_progression_tier()` method for current tier identification
- **Advancement validation**: `can_advance_domain()` method with cost checking

#### Insight Point Spending Options
- **8 spending categories** with different costs and effects:
  - `reroll_failed_action` (3 points): Immediate action reroll
  - `bonus_growth_points` (5 points): +2 growth points on next action
  - `temporary_tag_boost` (4 points): +1 tag rank for one action
  - `unlock_creative_solution` (6 points): Alternative problem-solving approaches
  - `accelerated_learning` (8 points): Double growth points for significant actions
  - `mastery_path_progress` (10 points): Advance current mastery path
  - `domain_cross_training` (7 points): Apply learning across domains
  - `wisdom_guidance` (5 points): Optimal approach insights

#### Key Methods
- `get_available_insight_options()`: Lists valid spending options based on character state
- `spend_insight_points()`: Processes insight point expenditure with validation
- `_apply_insight_effect()`: Executes the selected insight effect

### Testing Results
```
Available insight options: 8
Bonus growth points result: True
Remaining insight points: 15
Social domain tier: Skilled
Can advance social domain: False
Current tier: Skilled
```

## Phase 6: Enhanced Mastery Path Generation ✅ COMPLETE

### Implemented Features

#### Comprehensive Mastery Path Templates
- **21 total mastery paths** across all 7 domains
- **Domain-specific paths**:
  - **Body**: Warrior's Path, Acrobatic Master, Fortress Guardian
  - **Mind**: Scholar's Wisdom, Tactical Genius, Arcane Theorist
  - **Spirit**: Divine Channel, Willpower Master, Nature's Bond
  - **Craft**: Master Artisan, Inventor's Vision, Enchanter's Art
  - **Social**: Diplomat's Grace, Inspiring Leader, Shadow Manipulator
  - **Authority**: Natural Commander, Judge's Wisdom, Royal Presence
  - **Awareness**: Master Scout, Danger Sense, Information Broker

#### Anti-Grinding Mechanisms
- **Action tracking system**: `ACTION_GRINDING_TRACKER` monitors repeated actions
- **Time-window penalties**: 5-minute windows for penalty calculation
- **Escalating penalties**: 
  - Threshold: 3 repeated actions
  - Growth penalty: 50% reduction
  - Insight penalty: 30% reduction
- **`_check_grinding_penalty()`**: Automatic penalty calculation

#### Enhanced Path Management
- `get_mastery_path_info()`: Comprehensive path availability analysis
- `unlock_mastery_path()`: Path unlocking with requirement validation
- `activate_mastery_path()`: Path activation and benefit application
- `_check_mastery_requirements()`: Advanced requirement checking

### Testing Results
```
Available mastery paths for Social: 1
Unlocked paths: 0
Unlock Diplomat's Grace: True
Activate Diplomat's Grace: True
Grinding penalties: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1]
Anti-grinding is working!
```

## Phase 7: World Response Integration ✅ COMPLETE

### Implemented Features

#### World Impact Analysis
- **Multi-faceted impact assessment**:
  - **Reputation changes**: Leader, judge, commander, political standing
  - **Relationship effects**: NPC disposition modifications
  - **Economic impact**: Market and resource effects
  - **Political ramifications**: Faction and authority responses

#### AI-Driven Analysis Systems
- **`analyze_world_impact()`**: Comprehensive world state analysis
- **Specialized analyzers**:
  - `_calculate_reputation_impact()`: Reputation system integration
  - `_analyze_relationship_impact()`: NPC relationship management
  - `_analyze_economic_impact()`: Economic consequence modeling
  - `_analyze_political_impact()`: Political faction response

#### Narrative Consequence Generation
- **`generate_narrative_consequences()`**: Dynamic story element creation
- **Context-aware generation**: Based on action results and world impact
- **Scalable narrative depth**: 3-6 consequences per significant action

#### Adaptive Challenge System
- **`suggest_adaptive_challenges()`**: Performance-based difficulty adjustment
- **Challenge types**:
  - High success rate → Increase difficulty
  - Low success rate → Alternative approaches
  - Cross-domain opportunities for balanced growth

### Testing Results
```
Reputation changes: {'leader': 10, 'judge': 10, 'commander': 10, 'political': 5}
Relationship effects: {'guard_captain': {'change': 4, 'reason': 'Response to authority action', 'new_disposition': 'neutral'}}
Political ramifications: 1
Narrative consequences: 6
Suggested adaptive challenges: 1
```
