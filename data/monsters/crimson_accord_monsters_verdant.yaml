# Monster Threat Tier Comments for Balancing
#
# minion: Weak, common, often appear in groups. Designed to be easily defeated by a typical party or even solo adventurers. Good for swarms, distractions, or as fodder protecting stronger enemies.
# standard: Average threat, reasonable challenge for a solo adventurer or small group. Most wilderness encounters, patrols, or minor predators fall into this tier.
# elite: Stronger than standard, often requiring teamwork or tactics to overcome. May have unique abilities, resistances, or serve as "mini-bosses" in dungeons and special encounters.
# boss: Major threat. Usually the centerpiece of a quest, dungeon, or region. Bosses should be rare, have advanced tactics, multiple phases, and can defeat unprepared or disorganized parties.
# legendary: Unique, world-shaking threats. Their presence can alter the story, environment, or even politics of the world. Usually only one exists at a time. Defeating or encountering a legendary monster is a campaign-level event.
