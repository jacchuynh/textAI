Test script for the fully integrated AI GM Brain with all systems working together.

This test demonstrates how all systems work together cohesively:
1. Decision Logic system from Phase 3
2. Output Generation from Phase 4
3. World Reaction system from Phase 5
4. Pacing and ambient storytelling from Phase 6
5. Integration with domain and combat systems
