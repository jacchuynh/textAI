## 🎮 Demonstrated Capabilities

### Natural Language Equipment Commands
The system now successfully handles commands like:
- "equip iron sword" → ✅ Equipped to main_hand slot
- "wear leather armor" → ✅ Equipped to chest slot  
- "put on magic ring" → ✅ Equipped to ring_left slot
- "remove iron sword" → ✅ Unequipped from main_hand slot
- "take off ring" → ✅ Unequipped from ring_left slot

### Equipment State Management
- ✅ **Multi-slot Support**: main_hand, off_hand, chest, ring_left, etc.
- ✅ **State Persistence**: Equipment state maintained between commands
- ✅ **Inventory Integration**: Items properly moved between inventory and equipment
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Equipment display reflects current state
