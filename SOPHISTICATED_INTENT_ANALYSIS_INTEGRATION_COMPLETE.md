- **IntentAnalysisResult Dataclass**: Complete analysis results container

### 2. **SimpleIntentAnalyzer Class**
- **Dependency-Free Implementation**: Works without external NLP libraries
- **Keyword-Based Pattern Matching**: 7 goal categories, 6 approach types, 5 value categories, 5 constraints
- **Sophisticated Analysis Methods**: 12 specialized analysis methods
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies opposing intentions and resource competition
- **Paralysis Detection**: Recognizes when players are overwhelmed by choices
- **Timeline Inference**: Determines immediate vs long-term intentions

### 3. **Enhanced UnifiedProgressionSystem**
- **Advanced _analyze_player_intent Method**: 80+ lines of sophisticated analysis
- **Player Profile Tracking**: Persistent tracking of player patterns and consistency
- **Integration with Action Processing**: Seamless integration with existing progression system
- **6 New Helper Methods**: 
  - `_calculate_approach_consistency()`
  - `_calculate_goal_alignment_strength()`
  - `_detect_creative_approach()`
  - `_calculate_value_alignment()`
  - `_update_player_profile()`
  - `_simple_intent_analysis()` (fallback)

### 4. **Comprehensive Analysis Capabilities**
- **Goal Alignment Detection**: Matches player actions to declared goals
- **Value Consistency Checking**: Compares actions to demonstrated values
- **Creative Approach Recognition**: Identifies innovative solutions
- **Emotional State Assessment**: Detects player emotional context
- **Conflict Resolution Suggestions**: Provides guidance for opposing intentions
