What do you think about integrating Celery with Redis into our project. I've already set up the basic project structure and now need to integrate Celery with Redis for asynchronous task management, particularly for upcoming major game systems and potentially for optimizing existing ones.

**1. Project Overview & Current State:**

*   **Goal:** Create an immersive, dynamic RPG where the world reacts to player actions, supporting combat and slice-of-life campaigns.
*   **Core Tech Stack:**
    *   Python
    *   FastAPI (for the main API)
    *   Uvicorn (as the ASGI server)
    *   SQLAlchemy (for PostgreSQL interaction - database schema is evolving)
    *   ChromaDB (as a vector database, primarily for Langchain memory and semantic search)
    *   Langchain (for LLM interaction, memory management)
    *   OpenRouter (as the LLM gateway)
*   **Current Celery Setup:**
    *   `celery_app.py`: Initializes the Celery application, configured to use Redis as both broker and backend. It reads `REDIS_URL` from environment variables (defaulting to `redis://localhost:6379/0` for local dev) and includes `app.tasks`.
        ```python
        # Key parts of app/celery_app.py:
        import os
        from celery import Celery

        REDIS_URL = os.getenv('REDIS_URL', 'redis://localhost:6379/0')
        CELERY_BROKER_URL = REDIS_URL
        CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = REDIS_URL

        celery_app = Celery(
            'app',
            broker=CELERY_BROKER_URL,
            backend=CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND,
            include=['app.tasks']
        )
        celery_app.conf.update(
            task_serializer='json',
            accept_content=['json'],
            result_serializer='json',
            timezone='UTC',
            enable_utc=True,
        )
        ```
    *   `tasks.py`: Intended to hold all Celery task definitions. Currently contains placeholder/example tasks.
        ```python
        # Key parts of app/tasks.py:
        from .celery_app import celery_app

        @celery_app.task
        def example_task(x, y):
            return x + y

        @celery_app.task
        def long_running_npc_simulation_update(npc_id):
            import time
            print(f"Starting simulation update for NPC {npc_id}...")
            time.sleep(10) # Simulate work
            print(f"Finished simulation update for NPC {npc_id}.")
            return f"NPC {npc_id} updated successfully"
        ```

**2. Goal: Integrate Celery for Asynchronous Processing**

I need your help to design and implement Celery task integration for the following upcoming major systems and potentially refactor parts of existing/external systems to leverage Celery. The primary goals are to:
    *   Prevent blocking of the main FastAPI application by long-running processes.
    *   Enable scalable background processing for simulations and AI computations.
    *   Manage tasks that involve external API calls (like to LLMs via OpenRouter) asynchronously.

**3. Upcoming Major Systems Requiring Celery Integration:**

*   **A. NPC Simulation System:**
    *   **Description:** NPCs will have needs, goals, routines, and make complex decisions. They will react to the world and player actions.
    *   **Potential Celery Tasks:**
        *   `npc_decision_making_task(npc_id, current_world_state)`: For complex AI logic, potentially involving LLM calls for nuanced behavior or dialogue generation.
        *   `npc_routine_execution_task(npc_id, routine_step)`: For executing parts of an NPC's daily/long-term routine.
        *   `npc_needs_update_task(npc_id)`: Periodically updating NPC needs (hunger, rest, social).
        *   `npc_observe_environment_task(npc_id)`: Processing sensory input and updating NPC knowledge.
*   **B. Economy System (integrating logic from `/Users/jacc/Downloads/economy system 0.1.3/`):**
    *   **Description:** Simulating resource production, consumption, markets, trade between NPCs, factions, and the player.
    *   **Potential Celery Tasks:**
        *   `run_global_economic_tick_task()`: A periodic task to update the entire economy (or regional chunks).
        *   `process_npc_production_task(npc_id)`: NPC produces goods.
        *   `process_npc_consumption_task(npc_id)`: NPC consumes goods based on needs.
        *   `update_market_prices_task(market_id, item_id)`: Adjusting prices based on supply/demand.
*   **C. Dynamic Quest Generation System:**
    *   **Description:** Generating quests based on world state, NPC needs/goals, and player actions. This might involve LLM calls for narrative elements.
    *   **Potential Celery Tasks:**
        *   `generate_quest_plot_task(triggering_event_details, involved_npcs)`: LLM call to outline a quest.
        *   `populate_quest_objectives_task(quest_plot_id)`: Defining specific objectives, potentially with sub-tasks.
        *   `monitor_quest_progression_task(quest_id, player_actions)`: Checking if quest conditions are met.
*   **D. World State Management & Event Impact:**
    *   **Description:** Processing the consequences of major events (e.g., war, natural disaster, completion of a major quest) that affect many entities or regions.
    *   **Potential Celery Tasks:**
        *   `apply_event_impact_regionally_task(event_id, region_id)`: Calculating and applying changes to a specific region.
        *   `propagate_information_task(information_details, source_npc_id)`: Simulating the spread of news/rumors.

**4. Specific Integration Requirements & Guidance:**

*   **Task Identification:** For each system above (and potentially for existing logic in the `ai_gm_brain`), help identify functions/operations that are suitable for offloading to Celery tasks.
*   **Task Definition:** Show how to define these tasks in tasks.py, ensuring they are self-contained or receive all necessary data as arguments.
*   **Task Invocation:** Provide examples of how to call these tasks from the FastAPI endpoints (in api) or service layers (in services) using `.delay()` or `.apply_async()`.
*   **Handling Results & State Updates:**
    *   Discuss strategies for how the main application can get results from Celery tasks (e.g., polling `AsyncResult`, using Celery callbacks to trigger other tasks or update the database).
    *   How should game state (in PostgreSQL or in-memory representations) be updated based on the completion of Celery tasks?
*   **Designing New Systems with Celery:** Advise on how to structure the new services (e.g., `NpcService`, `EconomyService`) to effectively utilize Celery. For instance, a service method might dispatch a Celery task and return an immediate acknowledgment or a task ID.
*   **Data Serialization:** Ensure that data passed to Celery tasks is serializable (Pydantic models are generally fine as Celery is configured for JSON).
*   **Idempotency:** Where relevant, discuss if tasks should be designed to be idempotent.
*   **Error Handling & Retries:** Basic Celery error handling and retry mechanisms.

**5. Code and File Structure Context:**

*   All new Celery tasks should be defined in `tasks.py`.
*   Task invocation will primarily happen from new service files (e.g., `/app/services/npc_service.py`) or existing/new API endpoints.
*   The logic for the tasks themselves might originate from or be adapted from the external system folders mentioned.

**6. Deployment Context (Briefly):**

*   The application will eventually be deployed in an environment where `REDIS_URL` is set as an environment variable.
*   Celery workers will run as separate processes from the Uvicorn web server.

**7. Expected Output:**

*   **Code Examples:** Python code snippets for task definitions in tasks.py.
*   **File Modification Guidance:** Suggestions on where and how to modify existing or new files (e.g., in services or api) to call these Celery tasks.
*   **Architectural Advice:** Explanations and best practices for structuring the interaction between the main application and Celery workers for the systems described.
*   **Illustrative Scenarios:** Walk through one or two examples (e.g., an NPC making a complex decision, or an economic tick) showing the flow from API request -> service layer -> Celery task -> result handling.

**Constraint:** Please try to maintain the current project structure as much as possible. The focus is on integrating Celery for asynchronous operations within this structure.

Could you provide a detailed plan and code examples for achieving this Celery integration across my project?
