**Prompt for AI Assistant: Design and Implement a Dynamic Building & Upgrade System for Player-Owned Structures in a Medieval Fantasy RPG**

**Project Context:**
We are developing an AI-driven text-based fantasy RPG. The backend will be built using Python, with FastAPI for APIs, Pydantic for data validation/modeling, SQLAlchemy for database interaction (with a relational database like PostgreSQL or SQLite), and Celery with Redis for asynchronous tasks. Core systems include dynamic NPC generation, a comprehensive economy system, a dynamic quest system, and a detailed player-owned business simulation with a "slice-of-life" focus (which includes mechanics for property acquisition, potentially on unoccupied land).

This new system will enable players to construct and progressively upgrade their own buildings, particularly their business premises. The upgrade system should be organic, engaging, and offer meaningful choices that reflect the growth and specialization of their enterprise. This system will also serve as a foundational element for a future, more comprehensive city management system.

**Objective:**
Design and implement a dynamic building system that allows players to construct various structures from the ground up, and an integrated, deep upgrade system that allows these structures to evolve in functionality, appearance (descriptively), and efficiency. The system must be deeply intertwined with the player's business operations, the game's economy, and offer a tangible sense of progression and customization.

2.  **Core Services:**
    *   **`BuildingDesignAndKnowledgeService`:**

        *   `learn_or_purchase_blueprint(db, player_id, blueprint_id_or_source_details) -> bool`.
        *   `research_building_technology_or_upgrade(db, player_id, research_subject_str) -> ResearchProjectTracker`. (Could be a time/resource consuming activity).
    *   **`ConstructionManagementService`:**
        *   `initiate_building_project(db, player_id, property_id, blueprint_id, initial_resource_commitment_json) -> ConstructionOrUpgradeProject`.
        *   `initiate_upgrade_project(db, player_id, constructed_building_id, upgrade_node_id, initial_resource_commitment_json) -> ConstructionOrUpgradeProject`.
        *   `allocate_resources_to_project(db, project_id, item_id, quantity)`.
        *   `assign_labor_to_project(db, project_id, npc_laborer_ids_list_or_player_flag, hours_per_npc_or_player)`.
        *   `process_project_progress_tick(db, project_id, hours_passed)`: (Likely a Celery task) Updates progress based on allocated labor and resources. Consumes resources. Checks for stalls.
        *   `complete_project(db, project_id) -> ConstructedBuilding` (Updates the `ConstructedBuilding` with new features/upgrades or creates it).
    *   **`BuildingOperationsService`:**
        *   `get_player_building_details(db, player_id, constructed_building_id) -> ConstructedBuilding`.
        *   `perform_building_maintenance(db, constructed_building_id, maintenance_materials_json)` (Improves `current_condition_percentage`).
        *   `get_available_upgrades(db, constructed_building_id) -> List[BuildingUpgradeNode]`.
        *   `apply_cosmetic_customization(db, constructed_building_id, cosmetic_choice_details_json)` (e.g., paint color, sign design, non-functional decorations).

**II. Detailed Simulation Mechanics for Construction & Upgrades:**

*   **Site Preparation:** Initial phase for new constructions (clearing land, laying foundation) which consumes time and basic resources.
*   **Phased Progress:** Large projects might have distinct visual/descriptive phases of completion.
*   **Resource Logistics:** Player is responsible for ensuring materials are available at the construction site (or pays extra for delivery).
*   **Labor Management:**
    *   Player can contribute their own labor (consuming their time/stamina, potentially using their construction-related skills).
    *   Hiring NPC laborers (general or specialized like Masons, Carpenters) from the NPC pool. NPC skill levels can affect construction speed, resource efficiency (less waste), or quality of the finished work (e.g., higher condition, minor bonus). Wages are an ongoing cost.
*   **Tool & Equipment Requirements:** Certain constructions or upgrades might require specific tools (e.g., "Scaffolding," "Heavy Lifting Crane") which might need to be crafted, bought, or rented.
*   **Time Investment:** Construction and upgrades are not instant. They take significant in-game time, during which resources and labor are committed.

**III. Organic and Engaging Upgrade System - Key Design Principles:**

*   **Visible Evolution:** Upgrades must result in clear, descriptively noticeable changes to the building. It should *feel* different and more advanced.
*   **Meaningful Functional Improvements:** Upgrades should directly enhance the business's capabilities: unlock new crafting recipes, increase production speed/efficiency, expand capacity (storage, staff, customers), reduce spoilage, improve quality of goods, or enable new services.
*   **Branching Upgrade Paths & Specialization:** Avoid purely linear upgrades. Allow players to specialize their buildings. For example, a blacksmith shop could upgrade towards:
    *   *Mass Production:* Faster output, larger batches, lower per-unit cost.
    *   *Artisanal Quality:* Slower, more resource-intensive, but produces masterwork items with higher value/stats.
    *   *Weapon Specialization* vs. *Armor Specialization* vs. *Tool Specialization*.
*   **Discovery & Achievement:** Advanced or unique upgrades shouldn't all be immediately obvious. They might be unlocked through:
    *   Player skill progression in relevant crafts.
    *   Completing specific quests (e.g., helping a master artisan who then teaches a technique).
    *   Finding rare schematics or ancient texts.
    *   Successful research projects.
    *   Achieving high reputation with a relevant guild or faction.
*   **Interdependent Upgrades (Synergies):** Some upgrades might offer enhanced benefits if other complementary upgrades are also installed (e.g., an "Improved Ventilation Hood" for an alchemy lab is more effective if an "Expanded Herb Garden" upgrade provides fresher ingredients).
*   **Aesthetic & Functional Choices:** Some upgrades might offer a choice between different styles or minor functional variations that reflect player preference (e.g., "Stone Walls for Durability" vs. "Ornate Wooden Facade for Appeal").
*   **Resource Quality Matters:** For certain critical upgrades, using higher-quality or rarer materials in their construction could result in a superior version of that upgrade (e.g., an "Adamantine Anvil" vs. a standard "Steel Anvil").

**IV. Integration with Other Systems:**

*   **Economy System:** Primary source of all building materials, tools. Cost of specialized NPC labor. New/upgraded buildings become more efficient economic nodes.
*   **Player Business Simulation:** The `ConstructedBuilding` *is* the business. Its upgrades are the primary way a player invests in and grows their business's physical capabilities.
*   **NPC System:** NPCs are laborers, specialized craftsmen (who might be required for certain upgrades), architects, or even rivals whose building prowess the player might observe.
*   **Quest System:** Quests can revolve around acquiring rare blueprints, finding unique materials for a special upgrade, hiring a legendary builder, or even constructing specific buildings for an NPC or faction.
*   **Location System:** Buildings occupy plots within `Locations`. The type of land, local resources, and regional architectural styles could influence available blueprints or construction costs.
*   **Player Skills:** Skills like Carpentry, Masonry, Engineering, Architecture, or even specific crafting skills (Blacksmithing, Alchemy) can influence the player's ability to construct/upgrade, the speed, cost, quality, or unlock specific upgrade paths.

**V. Persistence & Management:**

*   All new Pydantic models (`BuildingBlueprint`, `ConstructedBuilding`, `ConstructionOrUpgradeProject`, `BuildingUpgradeNode`) must have corresponding SQLAlchemy models and robust CRUD operations.
*   The state of all player constructions and ongoing projects must be meticulously saved.

**VI. Future Considerations (Especially for City Management):**

*   **Public Works & Infrastructure:** The same core system (blueprints, resources, labor, time) can be adapted for the player (as a leader) to commission roads, walls, wells, markets, temples, guild halls, etc.
*   **Zoning & Urban Planning:** Defining areas for specific types of buildings.
*   **Building Interdependencies at City Scale:** E.g., a granary improving the efficiency of nearby farms.
*   **Housing for NPCs:** Player constructing and managing residential buildings, affecting NPC population and happiness.
*   **Defensive Structures:** Walls, towers, gatehouses with their own upgrade paths.

This system should provide a deeply satisfying loop of planning, gathering, building, and upgrading, allowing players to create truly unique and personalized establishments that are central to their "slice-of-life" business owner experience and serve as a strong foundation for later city-scale management.
