Enhanced Combat Features Integration Plan

This document outlines the integration of enhanced combat features with the
existing combat system to create a more sophisticated and engaging combat experience.

COMPLETED INTEGRATIONS:
✅ Enhanced roll methods for spell casting resolution
✅ Combat system updated to use enhanced rolls (roll_check_hybrid)
✅ Removed redundant _resolve_action_roll function
✅ Added helper methods for domain/tag/difficulty determination

AVAILABLE ENHANCED FEATURES:
1. Adaptive Enemy AI (adaptive_enemy_ai.py)
   - Enemy personalities with aggression, adaptability, risk-taking
   - Learning from player patterns
   - Varied combat behaviors

2. Advanced Status System (status_system.py)
   - Enhanced status effects with tiers and sources
   - Domain-specific modifiers
   - Status effect chains and interactions

3. Environment Effects (environment_effects.py)
   - Dynamic environmental conditions
   - Tactical opportunities and hazards
   - Environment-specific combat modifiers

4. Enhanced Damage Calculation (damage_calculation.py)
   - Momentum-based damage scaling
   - Environment factor integration
   - Status effect damage modifiers

5. Combat Memory System (combat_memory.py)
   - AI learning from combat patterns
   - Player behavior tracking
   - Adaptive difficulty

INTEGRATION PRIORITIES:

Phase 1: Status System Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Integrate enhanced status effects into combat_system.py
- Add status effect application to combat actions
- Update combat state to track enhanced status effects

Phase 2: Environment Effects Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)  
- Add environment effects to combat encounters
- Integrate environmental modifiers into roll calculations
- Add environment-specific combat options

Phase 3: Adaptive AI Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Replace simple enemy AI with adaptive enemy AI
- Add enemy personality system
- Implement learning behavior patterns

Phase 4: Enhanced Damage System (LOW PRIORITY)
- Replace basic damage calculation with enhanced system
- Add momentum tracking to combat state
- Integrate environment and status modifiers

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Start with status system as it has the most immediate gameplay impact
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing combat system
- Add new features as optional enhancements
- Provide configuration options for different complexity levels
