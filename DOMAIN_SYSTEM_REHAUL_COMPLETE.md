# Domain System Rehaul - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive rehaul of the domain system in TextRealmsAI following the phased implementation plan. The new system introduces sophisticated player intent analysis, dual resolution methods (dice and probability), and an advanced progression system with insight points and mastery paths.

## Phase 1: Core Data Models ✅ COMPLETE

### Enhanced Character Model (`models.py`)

**New Player Profile Attributes:**
- `declared_goals`: List[str] - Player-stated character development goals
- `learning_approach_preferences`: List[str] - Player-stated learning preferences  
- `value_system_preferences`: List[str] - Player-stated value system
- `relationship_priorities`: List[str] - Player-stated relationship priorities
- `demonstrated_values`: Dict[str, int] - Track consistency of demonstrated values
- `relationship_investments`: Dict[str, int] - Track investment with NPCs
- `risk_tolerance`: Optional[str] - Player's general risk tolerance

**New Progression System Attributes:**
- `insight_points`: int - Insight Points for alternative progression
- `mastery_paths`: List[Dict[str, Any]] - Unlocked/active mastery paths
- `growth_momentum`: Dict[DomainType, float] - Growth momentum multipliers per domain

**New Enums:**
- `ActionSignificanceTier`: TRIVIAL, MINOR, SIGNIFICANT, MAJOR, LEGENDARY
- `ResolutionMethod`: DICE, PROBABILITY

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing Character model functionality preserved
- Existing domain and tag systems maintained
- Model serialization updated to handle new fields

## Phase 2: UnifiedProgressionSystem ✅ COMPLETE

### Core System (`unified_progression_system.py`)

**Resolution Method Determination:**
- Intelligent selection between dice and probability based on:
  - Domain type (BODY/SPIRIT typically use dice)
  - Action type (combat/contested actions use dice)
  - Context (routine crafting uses probability)
  - Combat state and external challenges

**Dice Resolution:**
- Enhanced d20 system with multiple domain/tag support
- Critical success/failure handling
- Difficulty modifiers and breakdown tracking
- Comprehensive result data structure

**Probability Assessment:**
- Base 50% + Domain Value(×5) + Tag Rank(×8) + Modifiers
- Sophisticated modifier system:
  - Preparation Quality: -20 to +30%
  - Approach Effectiveness: -30 to +25%
  - NPC Disposition: -40 to +20%
  - Relationship History: -25 to +25%
- Automatic success/failure thresholds (90%+ / 14%-)
- Likelihood categorization (Almost Certain, Very Likely, Uncertain, Risky)

**Intent Analysis:**
- Goal alignment detection
- Creative approach recognition
- Value consistency tracking
- Foundation for future AI-driven analysis

## Phase 3: Growth Point & Insight Point System ✅ COMPLETE

### Action Significance Determination
- Automated tier assessment based on:
  - Player intent alignment with declared goals
  - Narrative impact level (0-3 scale)
  - Creative approach detection
  - Risk level multipliers (0.75x to 1.5x)
  - Explicit tier override capability

### Growth Point Calculation
- Tiered base rewards:
  - TRIVIAL: 1-2 points
  - MINOR: 3-5 points  
  - SIGNIFICANT: 6-10 points
  - MAJOR: 12-20 points
  - LEGENDARY: 25-30 points
- Success vs failure multipliers (failure = 60% of success)
- Creative approach bonuses (3-5 additional points)
- Risk level multipliers applied

### Insight Point System
- Failure-based learning rewards:
  - TRIVIAL failure: 1-2 IP
  - MINOR failure: 2-3 IP
  - SIGNIFICANT failure: 3-4 IP
  - MAJOR failure: 4-5 IP
  - LEGENDARY failure: 5-6 IP
- Creative attempt bonuses (+2 IP)
- Risk-taking bonuses (+1-3 IP for high risk)

### Progression Application
- Automatic domain growth point application
- Tag XP distribution to used skills
- Character update timestamp maintenance
- Level-up detection and processing

## Phase 4: Mastery Path System ✅ BASIC IMPLEMENTATION

### Dynamic Path Generation
- Eligibility checking at EXPERT+ tier
- Goal-based path suggestions:
  - "Master Diplomat" for social/negotiation goals
  - "Inspiring Leader" for leadership goals
- Extensible framework for additional paths
- Path activation and tracking system

### Player Agency Features
- Intent declaration integration
- Goal alignment bonuses in significance calculation
- Approach description analysis
- Foundation for consistency rewards and momentum system

## Integration & Backward Compatibility ✅ COMPLETE

### Updated DomainSystem (`domain_system.py`)
- New `process_action()` method using UnifiedProgressionSystem
- Deprecation warnings for old methods (`roll_check`, `log_domain_use`)
- Event system integration maintained
- Backward compatibility preserved for existing code

### Event System Integration
- Enhanced DOMAIN_CHECK events with progression data
- Growth point and insight point tracking in events
- Method type tracking (dice vs probability)
- Comprehensive context data for analytics
