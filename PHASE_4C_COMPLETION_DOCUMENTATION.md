## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Key Code Components Modified

#### 1. InventoryTool Fix (`parser_engine.py`)
**Issue**: UnboundLocalError - 'result' referenced before assignment  
**Solution**: Restructured method execution flow to ensure proper variable initialization

```python
# Fixed execution order to prevent UnboundLocalError
result = inventory_system.handle_player_command(player_id, action, item_name, quantity)
if result["success"]:
    return result["message"]
else:
    return f"Unable to {action}: {result['message']}"
```

#### 2. EquipTool Item Name Parsing (`parser_engine.py`)
**Issue**: Tool receiving full commands instead of extracted item names  
**Solution**: Implemented verb removal logic for equipment commands

```python
# Remove equipment verbs to extract clean item names
equipment_verbs = ["equip", "wear", "put on", "wield", "don"]
for verb in equipment_verbs:
    if item_name.lower().startswith(verb.lower()):
        item_name = item_name[len(verb):].strip()
        break
```

#### 3. UnequipTool Item Name Parsing (`parser_engine.py`)
**Issue**: Similar item name extraction needed for unequip commands  
**Solution**: Applied similar verb removal logic for unequip operations

```python
# Remove unequip verbs to extract item names or handle slot removal
unequip_verbs = ["unequip", "remove", "take off", "unwield", "doff"]
for verb in unequip_verbs:
    if item_name.lower().startswith(verb.lower()):
        item_name = item_name[len(verb):].strip()
        break
```

#### 4. Test Infrastructure Updates
**Issue**: Player ID mismatch between tests and parser expectations  
**Solution**: Updated all tests to use "default_player" for consistency

### Integration Architecture

The equipment system now operates through a sophisticated multi-layer architecture:

1. **Natural Language Layer** - LangChain agents parse user input
2. **Parser Engine Layer** - Intent recognition and command routing  
3. **Tool Execution Layer** - EquipTool, UnequipTool, InventoryTool
4. **System Integration Layer** - SystemIntegrationManager coordinates systems
5. **Core Systems Layer** - InventorySystem, EquipmentSystem handle operations
6. **Data Persistence Layer** - State management and persistence

## 🎮 User Experience Features

### Natural Language Support
Users can now use intuitive commands like:
- "equip iron sword"
